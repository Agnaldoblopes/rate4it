Her medical studies included a dissertation entitled &quot;Influences of the Basal Ganglia on the Reticular Formation.&quot; In 1990, Berretta worked in Dr. A.M. Graybiel&#39;s laboratory at MIT in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. Her studies demonstrated that stimulation of the motor cortex differentially affects gene expression in distinct neuronal populations. While at MIT, Berretta&#39;s long-standing interest in brain disorders deepened, prompting her to join McLean Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, in 1997. In Dr. F.M. Benes&#39; laboratory, she developed a rodent model designed to mimic dysfunctions of the amygdala in subjects with schizophrenia, and show that such dysfunction may contribute to changes in the hippocampus described in these patients. In 1999, Berretta began her work as an independent investigator as the director of the Laboratory for Translational Neuroscience at McLean Hospital. Her research is focused on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In particular, she and her group are investigating the role of glial cells and extracellular matrix, and their interactions with distinct neuronal populations, in the pathophysiology of these disorders.

There, he pursued studies of random structures and networks. In the early 1990s, Djordjevic moved to the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, where he designed a large database containing properties of radioactive streams from all US Department of Energy sites and multi-component glasses for safe storage of nuclear wastes. He has been interested and involved in the design of systems for processing and analysis of large data sets since. Over the years, his interests have shifted towards the techniques for processing, searching, storing, and retrieving natural language samples, applications of machine learning techniques, and neural networks.

His research interests are primarily in the areas of statistical models for rating competitors in games and sports, and in statistical methods applied to problems in health services research.<\/p>\n\n<p>Glickman&#39;s long-standing interest in methods for rating competitors in games and sports arose from his involvement in playing tournament chess, where he attained the title of US national master in 1988. Glickman is known for having invented the Glicko and Glicko-2 rating systems, both of which have been adopted by many gaming organizations internationally.<\/p> \n\n\n<p>Glickman has served as chair and program chair for the American Statistical Association&#39;s Section on Statistics in Sports, and has earned its award for Sports Statistician of the Year in 2009. He has co-founded and co-organizes the New England Symposium on Statistics in Sports, a bi-annual conference on the research and practice of applying statistical methods in sports. He is editor-in-chief for the <em>Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports<\/em>. At Harvard, he is the founding head of the new Lab for Sports Analytics.<\/p>\n\n<p>Many of Glickman&#39;s publications have been in the realm of health services research. In the mid-1990s, Glickman&#39;s work critiquing the resource-based relative value scale algorithm for the Medicare fee schedule led to his consultation to government agencies in Ontario and Alberta to develop a statistical approach for medical fee schedule construction. He has received National Institutes of Health and Veterans Affairs grants to study the genetic predisposition to disease onset for various cardiovascular diseases, and for studying the impact of medication adherence on health outcomes.\n<\/p>","degree":"PhD","affiliations":"Senior Lecturer on Statistics, Harvard University","display_name":"Mark

He works mostly in social and political philosophy and in ethics. His primary research areas are contemporary political philosophy (in particular questions of international justice, distributive justice, human rights, and property.) In 2012, he published two books on questions of global justice, <i>On Global Justice<\/i> (Princeton University Press), which sets out his own proposal for how to think about justice at the global level; and <i>Global Political Philosophy<\/i> (MacMillan), which is a text book introduction to the field of political philosophy that focuses on ethical questions about globalization. Both books combine foundational philosophical inquiry with relatively applied questions about immigration, climate change, obligations to future generations, institutional reform at the global level, and human rights. Risse studied philosophy, mathematics, and mathematical economics at the University of Bielefeld, the University of Pittsburgh, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Princeton University. He received his BA, BS, and MS in mathematics from Bielefeld, and his MA and PhD in philosophy from Princeton. Before coming to Harvard, he taught in the Department of Philosophy and the Program in Ethics, Politics and Economics at Yale.","degree":"PhD","affiliations":"Professor of Philosophy and Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy School","display_name":"Mathias Risse"}],"current_waitlist":3,"college_code":"E-","subjects":["Government"],"format":"On campus","term_code":"201902","active":true,"enrollment_type":"Limited to 19 students","schedule_code":"L","enrollment_limit":19,"term_description":"Spring Term 2019","has_schd":false,"days":["Tuesdays","Tuesdays"],"crn_as_string":23673},{"title_for_sort":"democracy and its discontents","end_times":["19:50"],"meeting_times":"Tuesdays, 5:50-7:50 pm","current_enrollment":69,"closed_or_canceled":false,"videos":[],"availability":"Open","title":"Democracy and Its Discontents","waitlist_limit":0,"instructors":["Gray, Sean"],"subject_and_course_code":"GOVT E-1063C","start_times":["17:50"],"course_code":"1063C","updated_at":"2019-02-04 04:50:54","instructor_affiliations":["Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy School"],"id":8459,"crn":25181,"section_number":null,"start_date":"2019-01-29","subject_code":"GOVT","credit_statuses":["Undergraduate","Graduate","Noncredit"],"course_code_int":1063,"reg_closed":false,"instructor_display":[{"summer_instructor":false,"faculty_directory_url":"https:\/\/www.extension.harvard.edu\/faculty-directory\/sean-gray","profile":null,"degree":"PhD","affiliations":"Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy School","display_name":"Sean Gray"}],"current_waitlist":0,"college_code":"E-","subjects":["Government"],"format":"On campus or online","term_code":"201902","active":true,"enrollment_type":null,"schedule_code":"H","enrollment_limit":999,"term_description":"Spring Term 2019","has_schd":false,"days":["Tuesdays"],"crn_as_string":25181},{"title_for_sort":"political corruption","end_times":["20:00"],"meeting_times":"Wednesdays, 6-8 pm","current_enrollment":53,"closed_or_canceled":true,"videos":[],"availability":"Closed","title":"Political Corruption","waitlist_limit":0,"instructors":["Baum, Jeeyang"],"subject_and_course_code":"GOVT E-1111","start_times":["18:00"],"course_code":"1111","updated_at":"2019-01-29 14:21:50","instructor_affiliations":["Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy School of Government"],"id":9242,"crn":15794,"section_number":null,"start_date":"2018-09-05","subject_code":"GOVT","credit_statuses":["Undergraduate","Graduate","Noncredit"],"course_code_int":1111,"reg_closed":true,"instructor_display":[{"summer_instructor":true,"faculty_directory_url":"https:\/\/www.extension.harvard.edu\/faculty-directory\/jeeyang-rhee-baum","profile":"<p>Jeeyang Rhee Baum&#39;s research and teaching interests include comparative political institutions, administrative law and regulatory reform, and political economy of bureaucratic reform, particularly as they relate to the enhancement of accountability, transparency, and public participation in policy development.

He first began teaching mathematics while completing his PhD in number theory at Harvard.  Since that time he has taught students from ages 7 to 70 in a wide range of settings including a prep school (Noble and Greenough), an afterschool program (The Math Circle at Harvard), and summer programs (Upward Bound and the Harvard Summer School), in addition to teaching in the Harvard math department and at the Extension School.  He credits his enjoyment of teaching to his parents who helped him experience the thrill of mathematical discovery when he was very young.

He received his PhD in psychology from the University of California at Santa Barbara in the area of developmental and evolutionary psychology. His research primarily focuses on the evolutionary origins and computational design of the mechanisms underlying human cooperation and social behavior. One line of his research, appearing in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences<\/i>, has explored how facets of the ancestral information landscape\u2014that the future of any interaction is uncertain\u2014conspire with distinctive features of the hominin social niche to select for organisms that are more generous, trusting, and cooperative than an otherwise rational analysis would predict. In related work, he has shown in a series of behavioral experiments how these and other fundamental components of human social behavior, like our concern for the treatment of others and our punitive sentiments towards bad actors, show intricate design to support the cultivation of mutually beneficial cooperative relationships and to improve their terms when they begin to function poorly. Another research focus concerns adaptations for gathering in human spatial cognition. For decades research in human spatial abilities revealed a robust male advantage in many tasks related to large-scale navigation. Yet, ethnographic surveys and archeological evidence suggests a longstanding sexual division of foraging labor with women engaging in more habitual gathering than men. Krasnow demonstrated that this inconsistency was due to the poor fit between the features of traditional tests of spatial cognition and the features of a spatial memory system designed for gathering.","degree":"PhD","affiliations":"Associate Professor of Psychology, Harvard University","display_name":"Max
